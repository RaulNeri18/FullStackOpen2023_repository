1. Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building. What are the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the language you picked?
In the JavaScript ecosystem, specific tools for common CI steps include ESLint for linting, Jest for testing, and webpack or Babel for building. ESLint helps maintain code quality by identifying and fixing problematic patterns. Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript applications, offering features like snapshot testing and code coverage. Webpack and Babel are commonly used for bundling and transpiling JavaScript code, respectively.

2. What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions? 
Besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, alternatives for CI setups include Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD. Travis CI provides a cloud-based CI service that integrates well with GitHub repositories, offering automatic testing and deployment. CircleCI offers flexible configuration options and supports various programming languages and workflows. GitLab CI/CD is part of the GitLab platform and provides a seamless CI/CD experience for projects hosted on GitLab repositories.

3. Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?
The decision to choose between a self-hosted or cloud-based environment depends on factors like budget, scalability, and control. A self-hosted environment offers more control over infrastructure and potentially lower costs in the long term. However, it requires maintenance, monitoring, and scalability planning. On the other hand, a cloud-based environment provides scalability, managed services, and less administrative overhead. To make this decision, consider factors like budget constraints, team expertise, security requirements, and project scalability needs.
